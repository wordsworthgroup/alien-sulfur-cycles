CAVEAT EMPTOR
I have extensively tested the model within
the regimes outlined in LoWoMo19's sensitivity tests of
Section 4.2 and Figure 4
outside of these parameters, I am confidently hopeful that
the model should run, but if you encounter nonsensical
results outside these inputs please let me know

I hopefully have put sufficient checks in place that you
cannot run the model by entering in bogus inputs
(e.g., mixing ratios that don't sum to 1)
or unintended combinations of inputs
(e.g., two booleans set to True where only one should be)
but I am, alas, not omnipotent,
so there may be more issues or ways to crash the program
than I have dreamt of in my philosophy
I'd recommend self checking what you are inputting makes
physical sense and carefully follows the outlined
instructions, rather than relying on my anticipation
of knowing such mistakes might be made and throwing errors

also note I have NOT put any checks in place to ensure user
use is confined to planetary parameters where the
assumptions of the paper hold
(e.g., you CAN make a hot Jupiter or a planet with a super
reduced atmosphere and have the code output results,
but obviously the tenets of the paper no longer hold)
again, check yourself b4 you wreck yourself

finally, pay attention to units requested of inputs as some are non-SI
(I know--it's an atrocity to mankind
my sincere apologies to the science gods)

# SET MODEL PARAMETERS HERE

# first, choose whether looking to test observability of
# 1) H2SO4-H2O aerosols ('aero') or
# 2) SO2 gas ('gas')
# NOTE, only these two options are available
# any other option will crash program
type_obs = 'aero' # or 'gas'

# now, set model parameters
# you can either choose one of our two default options or
# set the parameters yourself

# for model parameters used as "best guess" inputs from LoWoMo19
# make this boolean True
# otherwise set to False
is_best_params = True # [bool]

# for model parameters used as "limiting" inputs from LoWoMo19
# make this boolean True
# otherwise set to False
# NOTE, only one of is_best_params and is_limiting_params can be set to True
# or program will crash
is_limiting_params = False

# see Table 1 for best guess and limiting inputs
# Section 3 discusses why we chose each of these inputs
# NOTE, if you have 'aero' observation type
# you must also choose which type of star you're interested in
# with is_G or is_M with these is_*_params
# all other parameters below will be ignored EVEN IF YOU SET THEM
# if either of these booleans are True

# you can also input your own choices for these model parameters below
# in which case set BOTH these booleans to False

# -------------------------------------------------------------- #

# FOR AEROSOL OBSERVATION

# Mie scattering parameters
# to calculate scattering need to know index of refraction of aerosol and
# wavelength of incident light
# option 1 is to choose "default" G or M star settings

# SET OCEAN PARAMETERS HERE
# the pH and size of your ocean
# you can either run for one set of ocean parameters,
# a range of one ocean parameter and a single other,

# NOTE, if you wish to use arrays for both ocean parameters,
# the run function handles gridding all combinations of pH and ocean mass
# only input 1D arrays

# ocean pH
